# Data Structure and Algorithms

1. We are interested in finding rate of growth of runtimw with increase in size of input.
2. Big O -> Upper Bound 
    We are trying to find g(n) such that O(g(n)) = f(n) such that C1*g(n) <= f(n) <= C2*g(n) beyond n = n0
3. Omega -> Lower Bound
4. Theta -> Tight Bound
5. Asymptotic Analysis -> Performance / running time with large inpiut sizes
6. Running Time = Summation of running time of all fragments
